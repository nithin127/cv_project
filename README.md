# perp_vanishing_pts

This is the first part of the course project CS-763 Computer Vision, 
The project is based upon the following project by Varsha Hedau, et. al.

This part aims at detecting the perpendicular vanishing point for a given image, 
which would be later used to estimate the box layout of a given room
This is done by implementing the following paper mentioned below, along with some modifications as suggested by Varsha et. al.
